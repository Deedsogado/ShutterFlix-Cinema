# ShutterFlix-Cinema

Team final project for CS 135.

## Contribution to the team

The team consisted of myself and 3 other people. Each of us made 2 of the 8 pages on the site. I completed [index.html](http://deedsogado.github.io/ShutterFlix-Cinema/index.html), [deals.html](http://deedsogado.github.io/ShutterFlix-Cinema/deals.html), and created the structure, layout, and most of the CSS of the website.

## Disclaimer

The joke PDF files were included as a requirement of the project, and are NOT to be taken seriously. DO NOT send any information requested by the forms. That being said, the [Film Festivals](http://deedsogado.github.io/ShutterFlix-Cinema/filmfestivals.html) page is the funniest and was written by a good friend of mine.  You should read it.
