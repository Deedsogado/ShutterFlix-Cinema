	<h3>What is it?</h3>
	<p>ShutterFlix Cinema is a local community movie theatre that is dedicated to showing classic and independent films from small town producers.  We hold special <a href="filmfestivals.html">film festivals</a> to feature films made by our own community, but also show Box Office releases from Hollywood.</p>
	<p>Our mission is to bring to the world the often overlooked gems that come from independent and small town producers.  To this end we are always looking to expand, and need dedicated, self-motivated people to make it happen, including people to manage the theatres, make the films, and get the word out. if you would be interested in working for or with ShutterFlix Cinema, please visit our <a href="nowhiring.html">Now Hiring</a> section</p>
	<h3>When is it?</h3>
	<p>Most locations are open from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. weekdays, and from 8 a.m. to 11:45 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays.</p>
	<h3>Where is it?</h3>
	<p>As a local theatre, ShutterFlix Cinema doesn't have very many locations, and certainly isn't national or world wide. We only serve a few cities, but the exact locations and further details can be found on our <a href="locations.html">Locations page</a>.</p>
